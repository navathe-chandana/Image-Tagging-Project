# Image Tagging Project üñºÔ∏è

A simple **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built using **TensorFlow** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.  
This project is part of my **ShadowFox AIML Internship** tasks.

---

## üîπ Project Description

The project aims to develop a practical solution for **image classification** by training a model to recognize 10 basic classes:

- airplane  
- car  
- bird  
- cat  
- deer  
- dog  
- frog  
- horse  
- ship  
- truck  

The model is trained on **50,000 training images** and tested on **10,000 images**.  

---

## üîπ Features

- Preprocessing and normalization of images.  
- CNN architecture with 3 convolutional layers and 2 max-pooling layers.  
- Model training and evaluation on CIFAR-10.  
- Visualizations:
  - Sample images from dataset (`samples.png`)
  - Model predictions on test samples (`prediction_0.png` ‚Ä¶ `prediction_4.png`)
  - Training accuracy and loss graph (`history.png`)
- Trained model saved as `image_classifier.h5`.
